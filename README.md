# 4 Non Blondes – What's Up?

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Twenty-five years and my life
is still
Tryin' to get up that great big
hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew
I should
That the world was made up of
this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means
And so I cry sometimes when I'm
lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's
in my head
And I, I am feeling
A little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I
get real high
And I, scream from the top of
my lungs
What's goin' on
And I say hey, yea, yea, hey,
yea, yea
I said hey, what's goin' on
And I say hey, yea, yea, hey,
yea, yea
I said hey, what's goin' on
Ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh
And I try, oh my God do I try,
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray, oh my God do I
pray, I pray every single day
For a revolution
And so I cry sometimes when I'm
lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's
in my head
And I, I am feeling
A little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I
get real high
And I, scream from the top of
my lungs
What's goin' on
And I say hey, yea, yea, hey,
yea, yea
I said hey, what's goin' on
And I say hey, yea, yea, hey,
yea, yea yea yea
I said hey, what's goin' on
And I say hey, yea, yea
(Wake in the morning and I step
outside)
Hey, yea, yea
(Take a deep breath and I get
real high and I)
I said hey, what's goin' on
(What's goin' on)
And I say hey, yea, yea
(Wake in the morning and I step
outside)
Hey, yea, yea
(Take a deep breath and I get
real high and I)
I said hey, what's goin' on
Ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh
Twenty-five years and my life
is still
Tryin' to get up that great big
hill of hope
For a destination
